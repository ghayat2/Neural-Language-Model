i cursed my short , <unk> eyes . <eos>
where were all the damned <unk> ? <eos>
finding the <unk> was a <unk> , and the <unk> was a <unk> . <eos>
<unk> of <unk> <unk> topped the gate and rolled out of the <unk> . <eos>
her eyes were wide , and she was n't sure how to get her attention . <eos>
i went back into my office and looked at the phone sitting on the table . <eos>
given evidence collected from a murdered teen 's apartment , the <unk> was a <unk> . <eos>
at least i was n't sure what to do . <eos>
`` for a moment , i 'm not sure what i 'm doing . '' <eos>
but he seemed so excited about it . <eos>
as i approached , she was n't sure what to say . <eos>
if i had to be a <unk> , i would have been a <unk> . <eos>
laughing at their continued shock , maris reached up and closed his eyes . <eos>
she pointed to the <unk> . <eos>
she did n't want to be a <unk> . <eos>
he landed on a box of tissue and cleaned a spot off the floor . <eos>
cold , hard death gleamed in his eyes . <eos>
let 's go . '' <eos>
i am dead . <eos>
`` no , '' i said . <eos>
solutions do n't have to be a <unk> . <eos>
well then , he said raising his head . <eos>
